# HybridSP
HybridSP is a novel hybrid statistical potential that combines distance-dependent atom-atom, atom-residue, and orientation-dependent interactions into a unified scoring function. It demonstrates exceptional accuracy in protein-ligand docking and virtual screening, rivaling or even surpassing state-of-the-art deep learning models.
